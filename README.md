## Description
The Staff Trackr CLI is a powerful and intuitive Command Line Interface application designed for seamless management of employee databases. With its user-friendly interface, this application empowers HR professionals and managers to efficiently track, update, and organize employee information within their organization.

- Motivation: The motivation behind creating the Staff Trackr CLI stems from the need to streamline and simplify the management of employee databases for organizations of all sizes. Traditional employee data management methods often involve manual data entry, complex spreadsheets, and disparate information sources, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and security concerns.
- Purpose: Staff Trackr CLI addresses several problems related to the management of employee databases within organizations included but not limited to: Inefficiency in Data Management, Difficulty in Data Retrieval, along with Limited Accessibility
- What I learned: This application taught me the ins and outs of programming with MySql and pairing it with the Inquirer module for easy CLI operations.
